# GCCA

This repository is implementation of Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis(GCCA).
CCA can use only 2 data but GCCA can use more than 2 data.

## CCA

GCCA is the method to transform 2 data to one joint space. See example graph:

![CCA Plot Result](https://github.com/rupy/GCCA/blob/master/img/cca_plot.png)

CCA inplementation contains PCCA transform that is assumed that there is latent space in 2 data.

## GCCA

GCCA is the method to transform multiple data to one joint space. See example graph:

![GCCA Plot Result](https://github.com/rupy/GCCA/blob/master/img/gcca_plot.png)

You can give GCCA any number of data.
